## Interesting Fact

Switzerland is officially called the Swiss Confederation. It is notably neutral (for the past 190 years), and many international organizations are headquartered in the country. It is not a member of the European Union, although it has its own trade agreements with the EU. It is a federal republic, and is led by a Federal Council, consisting of seven people. Switzerland has existed in its present form since 1848. It has an area of 41,285 sq km, a population of 8 million, and a very high HDI of 0.913.
