## Interesting Fact

The region of Hungary was inhabited by multiple invaders historically. Medieval Hungary was conglomerated and established in 895. It was later part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1867, the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was formed. In 1918, Austria-Hungary dissolved, and Hungary was its own nation once again. It went through a Communist period, and in 1989 became a democratic parliamentary republic. There have been recent protests in Hungary against the government.

It has an area of 93,030 sq km, a population of 9.9 million, and a very high HDI of 0.831. 

The Rubik's cube was invented by a Hungarian.
