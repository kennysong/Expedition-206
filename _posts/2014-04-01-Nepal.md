## Interesting Fact

Nepal is the birthplace of Buddha, and was previously the only Hindu nation in the world (now it is secular). It has a population of about 26 million, and has a low HDI of 0.463. Expansion of education programs in the past 50 years has risen the literacy rate from 5% in 1952 to 48.2% in 2001. However, education equality and access is still a problem in Nepal. 

Mount Everest is in the border between Nepal and China (Tibet), though the route from Nepal is more popular.
