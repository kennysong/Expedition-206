Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern state, and its first unified kingdom was formed in 3150 BCE, with a dynastic system of pharaohs. It was then part of the Roman Empire, and later invaded by the Arabs. Egypt was later part of the Ottoman Empire, and then underwent several revolutions and change of governments.
