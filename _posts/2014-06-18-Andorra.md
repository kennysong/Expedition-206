## Interesting Fact

Andorra is officially called the Principality of Andorra. Its official language is Catalan, and the present Principality was formed in 1278 CE. Its main industry is tourism. It is a monarchy headed by two co-princes, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgell and the President of France. Thus Andorra is heavily tied to both Spain and France.

Andorra has an area of 467 sq km, a population of 85,000, and a very high HDI of 0.846.
