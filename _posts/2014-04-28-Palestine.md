## Interesting Fact

Palestine is strictly the geographic region in the middle of Israel; the State of Palestine is a sovereign state recognized by the UN. It is comprised of two territories: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It has a total area of 6,220 sq km, a population of 4.5 million, and a medium HDI of 0.670.

The current Israeli-Palestinian conflict is over the sovereignty over the region of Palestine, which includes (the capital of both countries) Jerusalem. Palestinians are mostly Muslim.
