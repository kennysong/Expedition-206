## Interesting Fact

French Guinana is not actually a sovereign state but it is a large, interesting region so I will dedicate a post to it.

French Guiana is officially called Guiana, and is an overseas department and region of France. During colonial times, there were five Guianas: Spanish Guiana (now Guayana Region in Venezuela), British Guiana (now Guyana), Dutch Guiana (now Suriname), French Guiana, and Portuguese Guiana (now Amap√° in Brazil).
