## Interesting Fact

Slovakia is officially called the Slovak Republic. It was settled by Celts in 450 BCE, and invaded by Mongols in 1241. It was then a part of the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s, and gained independence as Czechoslovakia from 1918. In 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 

Slovakia has an area of 49,035 sq km, a population of 5.4 million, and a very high HDI of 0.840.
