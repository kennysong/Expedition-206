## Interesting Fact

Greece is officially called the Hellenic Republic. It was the birthplace of Plato and Aristotle, and also the concept of democracy, in Athens. The Greek Empire preceded the Roman Empire, which conquered Greece in 27 BCE. It was later occupied by the Ottoman Empire, and gained independence in 1821. Greece was under both a military dictatorship and a fascist dictatorship during periods of time in the 1900s.

It has an area of 131,957 sq km, a population of 10.8 million, and a very high HDI of 0.860.
