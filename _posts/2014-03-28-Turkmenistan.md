## Interesting Fact

Turkmenistan has the world's fourth largest natural gas reserves, and has had strong economic growth in the past few years. Most of the country is covered in the Karakum Desert, which is one of the driest deserts in the world.

The "Door to Hell" is located in Turkmenistan, which is a large natural gas fire that has been burning continuously since 1971, when scientists lit it in order to destroy a potentially dangerous leakage of methane gas.
