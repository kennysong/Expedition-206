## Interesting Fact

Burkina Faso is also called Burkina. It is a landlocked country and was previously called the Republic of Upper Volta (named after the river to the south) until 1984. _Burkina_ and _Faso_ are both words from the country's two major native languages, which translates to "men of integrity" and "fatherland", respectively. In 1896, France gained control of the region, and Burkina Faso gained independence in 1960. 

Burkina faso has an area of 274,200 sq km, a population of 15.7 million, and a low HDI of 0.389.
