##Interesting Fact

Qatar is essentially a very small peninsula with massive oil reserves. Its economy heavily relies on petroleum and natural gas, and this combination of low population and high oil quantity give it the highest GDP per capita of any nation. Virtually all of their energy comes from these two nonrenewable sources. It is also an Emirate.
