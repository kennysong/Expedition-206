## Interesting Fact

Vietnam is also called the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The region of Vietnam has been inhabited since the Paleolithic age, and Homo erectus fossils have been found dating back to 500,000 BCE. It is currently one of the world's four remaining single-party socialist states. It has a population of 89 million and a medium HDI of 0.617. The capital of Vietnam is Ho Chi Minh City, named after a prominent North Vietnamese leader (previously named Saigon). 

Pho is a delicious Vietnamese dish.
