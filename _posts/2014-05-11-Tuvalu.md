## Interesting Fact

Tuvalu is a small island country in the Pacific Ocean, formerly called the Ellice Islands. Is used to be a part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, a British protectorate and colony until 1976 when they split, with the Gilbert Islands forming part of Kiribati. It was first inhabited in 1000 BCE, and was first sighted by Europeans in 1568. It is now a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state.

It is the third least populous sovereign state in the world. It has an area of 26 sq km and a population of 10,000.

Tuvalu is only 4.6 meters above sea level, so rising sea levels may submerge the country in the next 100 years.
