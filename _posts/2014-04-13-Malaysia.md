## Interesting Fact

Malaysia is split into two geographical parts, one on the Malay Peninsula (mainland) and one on the northern part of Borneo (East Malaysia). East Malaysia is approximately 61% of the total land area of Malaysia. Historically, the region of Malaysia was an important center of trade. Malaysia gained its independence from the British Empire on 1957. Singapore was part of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, before it declared its independence. 

Malaysia has a population of about 28 million and a high HDI of 0.781.
