## Interesting Fact

Liberia is officially called the Republic of Liberia. It is the only country in Africa founded by United States colonization. Starting in 1820, the region was populated by freed African American slaves. The Americo-Liberian leadership was overthrown in 1980, leading to two civil wars and political instability.

Liberia has a population of 4.1 million, an area of 111,369 sq km, and a low HDI of 0.388.
