##Interesting Fact

Bahrain is a tiny island nation, with an area of 750 sq km. Bahrain has been inhabited since at least 4000 BCE, and has historically been invaded many times due to its strategic location. It is currently well developed, with an HDI of 0.796. Much of its economy is dependent on petroleum exports.

The Qatar Bahrain Causeway will be the longest marine causeway in the world, set for completion in 2015.
