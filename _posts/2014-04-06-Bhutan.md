## Interesting Fact

Bhutan is a small country in the Himalaya region of South Asia. Bhutan has always been an independent country, with a population of about 600,000. 97% of the nation is Buddhist. The country was closed to outside travel until 1974, but now visitors must pay a $250 fee per day and sign up with a registered tour operator to enter the country. 

The Royal Bhutan Army has a voluntary membership of ~16,000 and is trained by the Indian Army.
