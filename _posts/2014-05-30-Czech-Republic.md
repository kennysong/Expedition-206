## Interesting Fact

The Czech Republic was part of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1992, after gaining independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It then peacefully split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. The Czech Republic has one of the least religious populations in the world -- with 34.2% declaring that they had no religion.

It has an area of 78,866 sq km, a population of 10.5 million, and a very high HDI of 0.865.
