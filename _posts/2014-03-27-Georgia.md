## Interesting Fact

Georgia was known as the Republic of Georgia from 1991 to 1995. The region is fairly mountainous, containing the Caucasus mountain range with the highest point (in Georgia) at 5,048m. The Caucasus contain the highest mountain in Europe, Mount Elbrus, which is in Russia. Also, Josef Stalin was born in Georgia.
