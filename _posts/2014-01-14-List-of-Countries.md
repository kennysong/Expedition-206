##Notes

The below list of countries was compiled from this [Wikipedia page](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents). I will mark off the ones I've already done as I go through them. It's interesting to note that there's only 204 countries on the list -- I haven't yet figured out the cause of this discrepancy with [this other list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states).

##Interesting Fact
The group consisting of Africa, Asia, and Europe is called Eurafrasia. (Apparently [also called](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Eurasia) Afro-Eurasia, Afrasia, or Eurafrasia).

Also interesting to note what determines a "continent". The term is broadly defined as a large continuous expanse of land, but borders are generally defined by convention rather than strict criteria. This leads to varying models of continents.

###Oceania

_Several terms are in use to describe the region comprising Australia and the nations of the Pacific Ocean. The term Oceania is usually preferred, and this is the term in use by the United Nations. The term Pacific Islands generally excludes the islands of New Zealand, and the continent of Australia. The indigenous Māori of New Zealand are a Polynesian people._

_Historically the region was called Australasia, although this often meant just Australia, New Zealand and sometimes Papua New Guinea. The term gives special emphasis to Australia and is falling out of favour._
