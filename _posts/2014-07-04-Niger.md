## Interesting Fact

Niger is officially called the Republic of Niger. The nation is predominantly Islamic, and has consistently ranked with the lowest HDI in the world. Niger was historically a French colony, and gained independence in 1960. This was then followed by many revolutions, a sign of government instability. Following the most recent coup in 2010, Niger is now a democratic, multi-party state. 

Niger has an area of 1,267,000, a population of 17.1 million, and a low HDI of 0.304.
