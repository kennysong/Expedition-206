##Interesting Fact

The area of Iraq was known as Mesopotamia and has been populated since 6000 BCE. The area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is called the "cradle of civilization" and is also deemed the birthplace of writing.

Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, which started the (second) Gulf War. The UN then placed an export embargo on oil, which was later slightly amended to aid the failing economy. The 2003 Iraq War was started by invading forces to search for "weapons of mass destruction", most prominently the United States'. Now, Iraq's HDI is 0.573.
