## Interesting Fact

Sri Lanka is also called the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, and was also known as Ceylon, Serendib, and Sinhale before 1972. It is South Asia's oldest democracy. Sri Lanka achieves a high HDI of 0.715, the only country in South Asia to do so. A land bridge between India and Sri Lanka used to exist until 1480 CE. 

A thirty-year civil war ended recently in 2009.
