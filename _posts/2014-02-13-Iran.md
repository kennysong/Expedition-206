##Interesting Fact

Iran was historically known as Persia, and was given the name Iran by the shah in 1935. Although Iran and Iraq have similar names in the Latin alphabet, they are significantly more different in Arabic and Persian. Its HDI is 0.742.

Fairly recently, the Western world has been concerned about Iran's possible nuclear weapons program. In February 2009, the US reported that Iran's nuclear weapons program had stopped in 2003 and would not be able to restart until 2013.
