##Notes

I just returned from a trip to Abu Dhabi, so it seems fitting to start with this country.

##Interesting Fact

The nation is comprised of seven emirates (hence the name, United Arab Emirates). An emirate is simply a geographic area (similar to a state or province) that is ruled by an emir. Technically, the entire UAE is an emirate as its president is an emir of one of the (sub-)emirates.

From observation, the word "Zayed" (زيد) can be spotted everywhere in the UAE: buildings, people's names (especially political figures), etc. It means growth, progress, and abundance in Arabic.

Dubai is also one of the most luxurious tourism-based cities in the world, holding ownership to the world's tallest tower, largest shopping mall, and only 7-star hotel (Burj Al Arab).
