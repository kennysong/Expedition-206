## Interesting Fact

Chad is officially called the Republic of Chad. Chad is constantly in a state of political violence and is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world. It was previously a French colony, until 1960 when it gained independence. There have been several consecutive (attempted) coup d'etats since then. 

Chad has an area of 1,284,000 sq km, a population of 10.3 million, and a low HDI of 0.328.
