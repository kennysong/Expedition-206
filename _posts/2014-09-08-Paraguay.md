## Interesting Fact

Paraguay is officially called the Republic of Paraguay. The region was previously a Spanish colony until it gained independence in 1811. This was immediately followed by political instability and the calamitous Paraguayan War from 1864 to 1870. 

Paraguay has a population of 6.8 million, an area of 406,752 sq km, and a medium HDI of 0.676.
