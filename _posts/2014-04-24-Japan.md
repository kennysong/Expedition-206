## Interesting Fact

Japan is an archipelago with 6,852 islands. Its largest island, Honshu, is the seventh largest island in the world. It has an area of 377,944 sq km, a population of 127 million, and a very high HDI of 0.901. Japan was first inhabited in the Paleolithic period in 30,000 BCE. 

Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution relinquishes Japan's right to engage in war, and was ratified in 1947 after WWII. Japan also does not have a military, as declared in Article 9, but maintains the Japan Self-Defense Forces for defense and peacekeeping purposes.

The Michelin Guide has awarded Japanese cities more Michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.
