## Interesting Fact

Singapore is also called the Republic of Singapore. It is a island country and city-state at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula. It has a total area of 716 sq km, and a population of 5 million. Singapore has a very high HDI of 0.895. 

Singapore is known for Singlish (Singaporean English), a pidgin of English that mixes in words from Malay and other local languages. The government runs a "Speak Good English Movement" against Singlish, as it gives a negative impression of Singaporeans.
